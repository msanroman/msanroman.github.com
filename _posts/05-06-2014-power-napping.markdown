Have you ever noticed, throughout the day, that you go back-and-forth between alertness and sleepiness? Well, that's normal. It's just your body clocks ticking, telling you to stop a little bit.

##Sleep-wake homeostasis and the circadian biological clocks

Sleep-wake homeostasis measures the need for sleep: the longer you stay awake, stronger is your need for sleep. It works both ways: the longer you've been sleeping, greater are the chances of awakening.

On the other hand, the circadian biological clock works by regulating the time between wakiness and sleepiness through the day. It goes up and down at different times at the day, reaching its lower points between 2:00 – 4:00am and **1:00 – 3:00pm**.

Does that look familiar? Yeah, it's the peak of the day, where we take a break from work, eat, and go back to it.

What if I tell you that you'll work better by taking a power nap?

##How power naps can boost your workday

A study by the Center for Functional and Molecular Imaging at Georgetown University showed that during naps, the brain's right hemisphere activivty boosted, and was also transmitting information regularly to the left hemisphere, which was pretty inactive.

That might suggest that power naps enhance creative thinking, which boosts problem-solving, and consolidate memory, which enhances learning.

Beware of doing it later than 3pm, or longer than 30 minutes. The first might cause a disruption on your night time sleep, and the latter might take you into developing *sleep intertia* (ever felt *groggy* after taking a nap?).

So, if you want to try it, here are a few tips:

+ Your body temperature drops when you fall asleep, so sleeping in a cool room might help to induce the body. But keep a blanket nearby, so you don't get too cold!
+ Blocking out lights helps you to fall asleep.
+ Do not feel guilty, taking a power nap is not laziness, but a way of improving your health.
+ Make it close to lunchtime, don't let much time to pass between lunch and napping, or digestion might get in your way.
+ Put an alarm to wake you to prevent sleep inertia (a [Jawbone UP](https://jawbone.com/up) might help you on that).
+ Do not get anxious if you don't sleep. If you don't feel like sleeping, don't.

Investing ~20 minutes of your time after lunch in a nap might save you hours of non-productivity or hitting your head against the wall to a problem. And hey, you might not need another coffee at all!

Try it! And <a href="http://twitter.com/msanromanv" target="_blank">I'd love to know your experiences</a> too :)
