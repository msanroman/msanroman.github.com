title: 'PHP continous testing script for NotifyOSD systems'
---

[@ArturoHerrero]([)https://twitter.com/#!/ArturoHerrero) published in [his blog](http://arturoherrero.com/2011/04/08/groovy-autotest-on-ubuntu/) a very interesting post about how he built a test-runner script using NotifyOSD, which is notification system used in Ubuntu, KUbuntu, Fedora and much more.

When I've started writing tests for a Symfony 2 project (maybe I should write more about them in another post) I also started missing a continous testing tool like Infinitest, so I decided to take a look at Arturo's post and build my own version for Fedora, which is the OS that I use lately.

So here's the code!
