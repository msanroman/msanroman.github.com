Are you still making an ssh connection like this?

{% highlight bash %}
in msanroman.github.com/ on master 
λ ssh mike@my.awesome.server
{% endhighlight %}

That is so 90s! Aren't your fingers tired of **so much keystrokes**?

Luckily for you, I've got a quick tip so your fingers doesn't fall apart. You can create a file named "config" under your .ssh directory, filling out something like this:

{% highlight bash %}
Host myalias
  User mike
  HostName my.awesome.server
{% endhighlight %}

And now you just type:

{% highlight bash %}
in msanroman.github.com/ on master 
λ ssh myalias
{% endhighlight %}

*Voilà!*

Oh, you need to connect to a server that needs a pem file for identification?

{% highlight bash %}
Host myalias
  User mike
  HostName my.awesome.server
  IdentityFile ~/path/to/your/pem/file.pem
{% endhighlight %}

Enjoy! :)
