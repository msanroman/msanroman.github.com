        <h2>Hey mate, it's dangerous being here</h2>
        <p>But don't worry, you can always go back to my <a href="/">list of posts</a> and pick one. Or you could learn something about <a href="/about">who I am</a>.</p>
        <p>Or maybe you are here just because you wanted being here, this little nowhere you've created with a broken link. You tried to be alone somewhere on this site and... <strong><em>bang!</em></strong> here I am too!</p>
        <p>Don't worry, I won't tell anyone</p>
