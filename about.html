    <h1> &raquo; who am I?</h1>
    <section class="post">
        <p>If you are asking about my bio, here it goes:</p>
        <p>My name is Miguel San Rom&aacute;n. I live in Barcelona, where I work at <a href="http://www.runroom.com">Runroom</a> as a software apprentice. Also, I'm on my last year of Computer Engineering at the Facultat d'Inform&agrave;tica de Barcelona (FIB).</p>
        <p>But, if you are asking about something more profound, maybe this will satisfy you:</p>
        <p>I am a passionate human being, and I fell in love with the capacity of creation and creativity inherent to the world of software developing. Also, I love lots of different music styles, and I love to play guitar. Drawing is the other of my passions, and I try to make some sketches every once in a while.</p>
       <!--  <p>If none of these descriptions were of your taste, maybe it's because the <i>&ldquo;I&rdquo;</i> in your question wasn't about <i>me</i> - it was about <strong>you</strong>. <i>Who are you?</i> I hope to know the answer to that question someday, as much as I hope to meet and have a drink with you. And maybe, while we're sharing that drink, you'll tell me.</p> -->
