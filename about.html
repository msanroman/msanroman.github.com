    <h1> &raquo; who am I?</h1>
    <section class="post">
        <p>If you are asking about my bio, here it goes:</p>
        <p>My name is Mike San Rom&aacute;n. I live in Barcelona, where I work at <a href="http://www.runroom.com">Runroom</a> as a software gentleman.</p>
        <p>But, if you are asking about something more profound, maybe this will satisfy you:</p>
        <p>I am a passionate human being, and I fell in love with the capacity of creation and creativity inherent to the world of software developing. Also, I love lots of different music styles, and I love to play guitar. Drawing is the other of my passions, and I try to make some sketches every once in a while.</p>
        <p>If you want to talk with me, you can <a href="mailto:mike@msanroman.me">email me</a> or follow me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/xtremevoodoo" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
